# Progress Log
PRD: cloudflare-skill-restructure
Started: 2026-01-12

## Codebase Patterns

### Reference Split Pattern
- README.md: Overview, key commands, navigation (<100 lines)
- configuration.md: Config reference, compact examples (<150 lines)
- api.md: Programmatic APIs, testing patterns (<150 lines)
- patterns.md: Common workflows, best practices (<150 lines)
- gotchas.md: Issues, troubleshooting, limits (<100 lines)
- All files: "See Also" section with cross-links to other files

<!-- Task logs below - APPEND ONLY -->

## Task - split-1
- Split 1470-line wrangler/SKILL.md into 5 focused files
- Files created:
  - README.md (90 lines) - Overview, essential commands
  - configuration.md (128 lines) - Config reference, bindings
  - api.md (140 lines) - Programmatic API (unstable_startWorker, getPlatformProxy)
  - patterns.md (150 lines) - Workflows, testing, optimization
  - gotchas.md (93 lines) - Common issues, troubleshooting
- Deleted: SKILL.md (1470 lines)
- All files have cross-reference sections
- **Learnings:**
  - Consolidate related subsections into single code blocks with comments
  - Aggressive line reduction: combine similar examples, remove redundancy
  - Cross-references at bottom keep navigation consistent

## Task - split-2
- Split 1439-line cache-reserve/SKILL.md into 5 focused files
- Files created:
  - README.md (93 lines) - Overview, eligibility, quick start
  - configuration.md (164 lines) - Dashboard, API, Cache Rules, wrangler
  - api.md (176 lines) - Workers integration, purging, monitoring, pricing
  - patterns.md (180 lines) - Best practices, architecture, cost optimization
  - gotchas.md (203 lines) - Issues, solutions, troubleshooting, limits
- Deleted: SKILL.md (1439 lines)
- All files have cross-reference sections
- **Learnings:**
  - Inline compression: combine similar patterns, use compact comments
  - Remove verbose examples when simpler versions convey same info
  - Consolidate header pattern examples into single line

## Task - split-3
- Split 1341-line stream/SKILL.md into 5 focused files
- Files created:
  - README.md (103 lines) - Overview, upload methods, playback, quick start
  - configuration.md (127 lines) - Env vars, wrangler, signing keys, webhooks, access rules
  - api.md (204 lines) - Upload, playback, signed URLs, live streaming, video management
  - patterns.md (152 lines) - Full-stack upload flow, webhooks, state management, best practices
  - gotchas.md (131 lines) - Common errors, troubleshooting, limits, security
- Deleted: SKILL.md (1341 lines)
- All files have cross-reference sections
- **Learnings:**
  - Consolidate config interfaces into single examples with inline comments
  - Reference full implementations in other files to avoid duplication
  - Compress similar API patterns (list/update/delete) into combined examples

## Task - split-4
- Split 1334-line workers/SKILL.md into 5 focused files
- Files created:
  - README.md (96 lines) - Overview, module pattern, essential commands, handler signatures
  - configuration.md (147 lines) - wrangler.jsonc setup, bindings (KV, R2, D1, DO, queues, services), TypeScript
  - api.md (137 lines) - Fetch handler, execution context, bindings access, Cache API, HTMLRewriter, WebSockets, Durable Objects, other handlers
  - patterns.md (149 lines) - Error handling, CORS, routing, performance, streaming, testing, deployment, monitoring, security, gradual rollouts
  - gotchas.md (99 lines) - CPU limits, statelessness, response streams, Node.js compat, global scope, limits table, common errors
- Deleted: SKILL.md (1334 lines)
- All files have cross-reference sections linking to kv, d1, r2, durable-objects, queues
- **Learnings:**
  - Aggressive inline compression: combine related concepts in single code blocks
  - Reference other files to avoid duplication (e.g., rate limiting -> durable-objects)
  - Use compact table format for limits/bindings reference
  - Single-line patterns for simple examples when appropriate

## Task - split-5
- Split 1244-line realtimekit/SKILL.md into 5 focused files (existing files trimmed)
- Files updated/verified:
  - README.md (81 lines) - Overview, core concepts, quick start, pricing
  - configuration.md (147 lines) - SDK install, client config, presets, wrangler multi-env, TURN
  - api.md (164 lines) - Meeting object API, REST endpoints, session lifecycle
  - patterns.md (155 lines) - UI kit, core SDK, video grid, device selection, chat, hooks, backend integration, best practices
  - gotchas.md (172 lines) - Common issues, limits, network requirements, debugging, security, performance
- Deleted: SKILL.md (1244 lines)
- All files have cross-reference sections
- **Learnings:**
  - Inline code compression: combine similar examples, remove line breaks in simple patterns
  - Merge related patterns into single code blocks with comments
  - Consolidate security/performance sections into compact lists
